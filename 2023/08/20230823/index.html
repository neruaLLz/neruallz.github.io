        <p>When you look at something that you really rather not do, it seems that you activate the areas of your brain associated with pain. Your brain, naturally enough, looks for a way to stop that negative stimulation by switching your attention to something else.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the trick. Researchers discovered that not long after people might start actually working out what they didn&rsquo;t like, that neurodiscomfort disappeared. So it seems what happens when you procrastinate, is something like this.</p>
<p>First, you observe, and get a cue about something that causes a tiny bit of unease. You don&rsquo;t like it, so to make the sensation go away you turn your attention from whatever caused that unease. You turn toward something more pleasant. The result, you feel happier,</p>
<p>But in the mean, time I&rsquo;m going to let you in on a handy little mental tool. This tool is called, the Pomodoro. It was invented by Francesco Cirillo, in the early 1980&rsquo;s. Pomodoro is Italian for tomato. The timer you use often looks like a tomato and really, a timer is all there is to this elegant little technique. All you need to do, is set a timer to 25 minutes, turn off all interruptions, and then focus. That&rsquo;s it! Most anybody can focus for 25 minutes. The only last important thing is to give yourself a little reward when you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a cow for example, out standing in a field. If you have the word cow, you can point right to a cow to learn what that word means. Even the letters for the word cow, C-O-W, are roughly analogous to sounds that they stand for.</p>
<p>But for mathematical ideas, there&rsquo;s often no analogous thing that you can point to. There are no plus signs standing out in a field. No multiplication, division, or other kinds of things that can directly equate to mini mathematical or scientific terms. These terms are more abstract, in other words.</p>
<p>Well, you might say, yeah, but what about ones like love, zest, or hope? These abstract terms are often related to our emotions. We can feel our emotions, even if we can&rsquo;t see and point to concrete examples, like we could with the cow.</p>
<p>This means it&rsquo;s important to practice with ideas and concepts your learning in math and science, just like anything else you&rsquo;re learning. to help enhance and strengthen the neural connection your making during the learning process.</p>
<p>You can see on your left here the symbolic representation of a thought pattern. Neurons become linked together through repeated use. The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice in order to bring those ideas into reality for you.</p>
<p>Even if the ideas you&rsquo;re dealing with are abstract, the neural thought patterns you are creating are real and concrete. At least they are if you build and strengthen them through practice.</p>
<p>Practice makes permanent.</p>
<p>During this time of seeming relaxation, your brain&rsquo;s diffuse mode has a chance to work away in the background and help you out with your conceptual understanding. Your, your neural mortar in some sense has a chance to dry. If you don&rsquo;t do this, if instead you learn by cramming, your knowledge base will look more like this, all in a jumble with everything confused, a poor foundation.</p>
