        <p><strong>Loop</strong>: Looping allows you to take the same action, or set of actions, with every item in a list.</p>
<p><strong>range() function</strong>: Python’s &lsquo;range()&rsquo; function makes it easy to generate a series of numbers. This is another result of the off-by-one behavior you’ll see often in programming languages.The &lsquo;range()&rsquo; function causes Python to start counting at the first value you give it, and it stops when it reaches the second value you provide. Because it stops at that second value, the output never contains the end value, which would have been 5 in this case. (p. 57)</p>
<p>If your output is different from what you expect when you’re using &lsquo;range()&rsquo;, try adjusting your end value by 1. (p. 57)</p>
<p>You can also pass &lsquo;range()&rsquo; only one argument, and it will start the sequence of numbers at 0. For example, &lsquo;range(6)&rsquo; would return the numbers from 0 through 5. (p. 57)</p>
<p><strong>list() function</strong>: If you want to make a list of numbers, you can convert the results of range() directly into a list using the list() function. When you wrap list() around a call to the range() function, the output will be a list of numbers.</p>
<p>Python refers to values that cannot change as <em>immutable</em>, and an immutable list is called a <em>tuple</em>. A tuple looks just like a list, except you use parentheses instead of square brackets.</p>
<p>At the heart of every if statement is an expression that can be evaluated as True or False and is called a conditional test.(p. 72)</p>
<p>Python uses the values True and False to decide whether the code in an if statement should be executed. If a conditional test evaluates to True, Python executes the code following the if statement. If the test evaluates to False, Python ignores the code following the if statement. (p. 72)</p>
<p>A Boolean expression is just another name for a conditional test. A Boolean value is either True or False, just like the value of a conditional expression after it has been evaluated. (p. 77)</p>
<p>Boolean values are often used to keep track of certain conditions, such as whether a game is running or whether a user can edit certain content on a website. Boolean values provide an efficient way to track the state of a program or a particular condition that is important in your program. (p. 77)</p>
<p>The if-elif-else Chain: Often, you’ll need to test more than two possible situations, and to evaluate these you can use Python’s if-elif-else syntax. Python executes only one block in an if-elif-else chain. It runs each conditional test in order, until one passes. When a test passes, the code following that test is executed and Python skips the rest of the tests. (p. 80)</p>
<p>You can use as many elif blocks in your code as you like. (p. 81)</p>
<p>Testing Multiple Conditions: However, sometimes it’s important to check all conditions of interest. In this case, you should use <strong>a series of simple <em><strong>if</strong></em> statements with no elif or else blocks</strong>. This technique makes sense when more than one condition could be True, and you want to act on every condition that is True. (p. 82)</p>
<p>dictionary: A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is connected to a value, and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key. A key’s value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary. In fact, you can use any object that you can create in Python as a value in a dictionary. In Python, a dictionary is wrapped in braces ({}) with a series of key-value pairs inside the braces. (p. 92)</p>
<p>key-value pair: A key-value pair is a set of values associated with each other. When you provide a key, Python returns the value associated with that key. Every key is connected to its value by a colon, and individual key-value pairs are separated by commas. You can store as many key-value pairs as you want in a dictionary. The simplest dictionary has exactly one key-value pair, as shown in this modified version of the alien_0 dictionary:</p>
<p>alien_0 = {&lsquo;color&rsquo;: &lsquo;green&rsquo;}</p>
<p>This dictionary stores one piece of information about alien_0: the alien’s color. The string &lsquo;color&rsquo; is a key in this dictionary, and its associated value is &lsquo;green&rsquo;. (p. 92)</p>
<p>Set: A set is a collection in which each item must be unique.</p>
<p>Nesting: Sometimes you’ll want to store multiple dictionaries in a list, or a list of items as a value in a dictionary. This is called nesting. You can nest dictionaries
inside a list, a list of items inside a dictionary, or even a dictionary inside
another dictionary. Nesting is a powerful feature. (p. 105)</p>
