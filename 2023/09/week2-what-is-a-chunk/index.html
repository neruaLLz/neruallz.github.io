        <p>Just memorizing a fact without understanding or context doesn&rsquo;t help you understand what&rsquo;s really going on or how the concept fits together with other concepts you&rsquo;re learning.</p>
<p>Notice there are no interlocking puzzle edges on the puzzle piece to help you fit it to other pieces.</p>
<p>Focusing your attention to connect parts of the brain to tie together ideas is an important part of the focused mode of learning. It is also often what helps get you started in creating a chunk.</p>
<p>Interestingly when you&rsquo;re stressed your attentional octopus begins to lose the ability to make some of those connections. This is why your brain doesn&rsquo;t seem to work right when you&rsquo;re angry, stressed, or afraid.</p>
<p>Chunks are pieces of information, neuroscientifically speaking, through bound together through meaning or use.</p>
<p>As it turns out one of the first steps towards gaining expertise in academic topics is to create conceptual chunks, mental leaps that unite scattered bits of information through meaning. The concept of neural chunks also applies to sports, music, dance, really just about anything that humans can get good at.</p>
<p>Basically, a chunk means a network of neurons that are used to firing together so you can think a thought or perform an action smoothly and effectively.</p>
<p>Focused practice and repetition, the creation of strong memory traces, helps you to create chunks.</p>
<p>The path to expertise is built little by little, small chunks can become larger, and all of the expertise serves to underpin more creative interpretations as you gradually become a master of the material.</p>
<p>In other words, practice and repetition in building chunks aren&rsquo;t all you need to become a truly creative master of the material you&rsquo;re learning.</p>
<p>Chunking helps your brain run more efficiently. Once you chunk an idea, a concept, or an action, you don&rsquo;t know need to remember all the little underlying details. You&rsquo;ve got the main idea, the chunk, and that&rsquo;s enough.</p>
