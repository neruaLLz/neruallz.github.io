The best chunks are the ones that are so well ingrained that you don&rsquo;t even have to consciously think about connecting the neural pattern together.
That actually is the point of making complex ideas, movements or reactions into a single chunk.
You can see this in language learning.
In the beginning, often just saying a single word with the proper nuance, tone, and accent involves a lot of practice." />

        <p>Getting an initial sense of the pattern you want to master for yourself is similar for most subjects or skills.</p>
<p>The best chunks are the ones that are so well ingrained that you don&rsquo;t even have to consciously think about connecting the neural pattern together.</p>
<p>That actually is the point of making complex ideas, movements or reactions into a single chunk.</p>
<p>You can see this in language learning.</p>
<p>In the beginning, often just saying a single word with the proper nuance, tone, and accent involves a lot of practice. Stringing extemporaneous sentences together involves the ability to creatively mix together various complex mini chunks and chunks in the new language.</p>
<p>One concern about using worked out examples in math and science to help you in starting to form chunks, is that it can be all too easy to focus too much on why an individual step works and not on the connection between steps. That is on why this particular step is the next thing you should do.</p>
<p>So, keep in mind that I&rsquo;m not just talking about a cookie cutter, just do as you&rsquo;re told mindless approach when following a worked-out solution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like using a roadmap to help you when traveling to a new place. Pay attention to what&rsquo;s going on around you when you&rsquo;re using the map and soon you&rsquo;ll find yourself able to get there on your own. You&rsquo;ll even be able to figure out new ways of getting there.</p>

        <p class="excerpt">In this video, I&rsquo;m going to walk you through the basic steps behind how to make a chunk.
Every discipline is a little different.
The first step on chunking is simply to focus your undivided attention on the information you want to chunk.
