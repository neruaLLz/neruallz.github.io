<meta property="og:description" content="Neuromodulators are chemicals that influence how a neuron responds to other neurons, and today we will discuss three of them; acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin.
Acetylcholine neurons form neuromodulatory connections to the cortex that are particularly important for focused learning when you are paying close attention. These acetylcholine neurons project widely and activate circuits that control synaptic plasticity leading to new long term memory. Neuromodulators also have a profound impact on your unconscious mind." />

        <p>Neuromodulators are chemicals that influence how a neuron responds to other neurons, and today we will discuss three of them; acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine neurons form neuromodulatory connections to the cortex that are particularly important for focused learning when you are paying close attention. These acetylcholine neurons project widely and activate circuits that control synaptic plasticity leading to new long term memory. Neuromodulators also have a profound impact on your unconscious mind.</p>
<p>Dopamine is released from these neurons when we receive an unexpected reward. Dopamine signals project widely and have a very powerful effect on learning, and this is something that also affects decision-making, and even the value of sensory inputs. Dopamine is in the business of predicting future rewards and not just the immediate reward. This can motivate you to do something that may not be rewarding right now, but will lead to a much better reward in the future.</p>
<p>Loss of dopamine neurons leads to a lack of motivation and something called anhedonia, which is a loss of interest in things that once gave you pleasure. Severe loss of dopamine neurons causes resting tremor, slowness, rigidity, this is called Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. Ultimately, it leads to catatonia, a complete lack of any movement.</p>
<p>Serotonin is a third diffuse neuromodulatory system that strongly affects your social life.</p>
<p>Finally, your emotions strongly affect learning as you are well aware. Emotions were once thought to be separate from cognition, but recent research has shown that emotions are intertwined with perception and attention and interact with learning and memory.</p>
<p>The amygdala is a part of the limbic system which, together with hippocampus, is involved in processing memory and decision-making as well as regulating emotional reactions. You will want to keep your amygdala happy to be an effective learner. The emotions and your neuromodulatory systems are slower than perception and action, but are no less important for successful learning.</p>
