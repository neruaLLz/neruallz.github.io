        <p>But psychologist, Jeffrey Karpicke, has shown that this approach is actually much less productive than another, very simple, technique. Recall. After you&rsquo;ve read the material, simply look away, and see what you can recall from the material you&rsquo;ve just read.</p>
<p>Students studied a scientific text and then practiced it, by recalling as much of the information as they could. Then they re-studied the text and recalled it again. That is, they tried to remember the key ideas, once more.</p>
<p>The results, in the same amount of time, by simply practising and recalling the material students learned far more and at a much deeper level than they did using any other approach. Including simply rereading the text a number of times. Or drawing concept maps that supposedly enrich the relationships in the materials under study.</p>
<p>When we retrieve knowledge, we&rsquo;re not just being mindless robots. The retrieval process itself enhances deep learning, and helps us to begin forming chunks. It&rsquo;s almost as if the recall process helps build in little neural hooks, that we can hang our thinking on.</p>
<p>Even more of a surprise to researchers, was that the students themselves predicted that simply reading and recalling the materials, wasn&rsquo;t the best way to learn. They thought, concept mapping, drawing diagrams that show the relationship between the concepts would be the best.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re trying to build connections between chunks, before the basic chunks are embedded in the brain, it doesn&rsquo;t work as well. It&rsquo;s like trying to learn advanced strategy in chess, before you even understand the basic concepts of how the pieces move.</p>
<p>Using recall, mental retrieval of the key ideas, rather than passive rereading, will make your study time more focused and effective. The only time rereading text seems to be effective, is if you let time pass between the rereading, so that it becomes more of an exercise in spaced repetition.</p>
<p>Merely glancing at a solution and thinking you truly know it yourself is one of the most common illusions of competence in learning. You must have the information persisting in your memory if you&rsquo;re to master the material well enough to do well on tests and to think creatively with it.</p>
<p>In a related thing, you may be surprised to learn that highlighting and underlining must be done very carefully. Otherwise it can not only be ineffective, but also misleading. It&rsquo;s as if, making lots of motions with your hand can fool you into thinking you&rsquo;ve placed the concept in your brain.</p>
<p>If you do mark up the text, try to look for main ideas before making any marks. And try to keep your underlining or highlighting to a minimum. One sentence or less per paragraph. On the other hand, words or notes in a margin that synthesize key concepts are a very good idea.</p>
<p>The reason students like to keep rereading their notes or a textbook, is that when they have the book or Google open right in front of them, it provides the illusion that the material is also in their brains.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not, because it can be easier to look at the book instead of recalling, students persist in their illusions studying in a way that just isn&rsquo;t very effective.</p>
<p>This is a reminder that just wanting to learn the material, and spending a lot of time with it, doesn&rsquo;t guarantee you&rsquo;ll actually learn it.</p>
<p><strong>A super helpful way to make sure you&rsquo;re learning and not fooling yourself with illusions of competence, is to test yourself on whatever you&rsquo;re learning.</strong></p>
<p>In some sense, that&rsquo;s what <strong>recall</strong> is actually doing. Allowing you to see whether or not you really grasp an idea. If you make a mistake in what you are doing, it&rsquo;s actually a very good thing. You want to try not to repeat your mistakes, of course, but mistakes are very valuable to make in your little self tests before high stakes real tests. Because they allow you to make repairs and you&rsquo;re thinking flaws bit by bit mistakes help correct your thinking, so that you can learn better and do better.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another tip, recalling material when you are outside your usual place of study can also help you strengthen your grasp of the material. You don&rsquo;t realize it, but when you are learning something new you can often take in subliminal cues for the room and the space around you at the time you were originally learning the material.</p>
<p>By recalling and thinking about the material when you are in various physical environment, you become independent of the cues from any one given location. That helps you avoid the problem of the test room being different from where you originally learned the material.</p>
