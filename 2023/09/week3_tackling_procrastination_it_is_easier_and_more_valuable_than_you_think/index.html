<meta property="og:description" content="The reason that learning to avoid procrastination is so important is that good learning is a bit by bit activity. You want to avoid cramming, which doesn&rsquo;t build solid neural structures, by putting the same amount of time into your learning. But spacing that learning out by starting earlier, you&rsquo;ll learn better.
First things first, unlike procrastination which is easy to fall into, willpower is hard to come by. It uses a lot of neural resources." />

        <p>The reason that learning to avoid procrastination is so important is that good learning is a bit by bit activity. You want to avoid cramming, which doesn&rsquo;t build solid neural structures, by putting the same amount of time into your learning. But spacing that learning out by starting earlier, you&rsquo;ll learn better.</p>
<p>First things first, unlike procrastination which is easy to fall into, <strong>willpower</strong> is hard to come by. It uses a lot of neural resources. You shouldn&rsquo;t waste willpower on fending off procrastination except when absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Best of all, as you&rsquo;ll see, you don&rsquo;t need to. If you&rsquo;ll remember, <strong>we procrastinate about things that make us feel a little bit uncomfortable</strong>. You think about something you don&rsquo;t particularly like, and the pain centers of your brain light up. So, you shift and narrow your focus of attention to something more enjoyable. This causes you to feel better at least temporarily.</p>
<p><strong>But sadly, the long-term effects of habitual avoidance can be nasty.</strong> When you put off your studies, it can become even more painful to think about studying it.</p>
<p>Procrastination can be a single, monumentally, important keystone bad habit, a habit, in other words, that influences many important areas of your life. If you improve your abilities in this area, many other positive changes will gradually begin to unfold.</p>
<p><strong>Procrastination shares features with addiction. It offers temporary excitement and relief from sometimes boring reality.</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to fool yourself, for example, into thinking that the best use of any given moment is surfing the web for information instead of actually reading the textbook or doing the assigned problems. You&rsquo;ll start to tell yourself stories. For example, you might tell yourself that organic chemistry requires spacial reasoning, your weakness. So, of course, you&rsquo;re doing very poorly at it.</p>
<p>You devise irrational excuses that sound superficially reasonable like, if I study too far ahead of the test, I&rsquo;ll forget the material. If you&rsquo;re troubled by procrastination, you may even start telling yourself that procrastination is an innate unchangeable characteristic.</p>
<p><strong>The higher you go in your studies however, the more important it is to take control of procrastination.</strong> Habits that worked in earlier years can turn around and bite you.</p>
<p><strong>You should be making the decisions, not your well-meaning but unthinking zombies, your habits.</strong> As you&rsquo;ll see, the strategies for dealing with procrastination are simple. It&rsquo;s just that sometimes they aren&rsquo;t intuitively obvious.</p>
<p>Procrastinators put off just that one little thing. They do it again and again, gradually growing used to it. They can even look healthy, but the long-term effects not so good.</p>
