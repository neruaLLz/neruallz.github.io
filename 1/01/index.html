        <p>One of the best ways of being effective in your learning is to use mental tools and tricks to inspire and motivate yourself.</p>
<p>First, when it comes to learning in general, you should realize that it&rsquo;s perfectly normal to start with a few negative feelings about beginning a learning session. Even when it&rsquo;s a subject you ordinary like, it&rsquo;s how you handle those feelings that matters. Researchers have found that <strong>nonprocrastinators put their negative thinking aside saying things to themselves like. Quit wasting time and just get on with it, once you get going, you&rsquo;ll feel better about it.</strong> If you find yourself avoiding certain tasks because they make you feel uncomfortable, you should know there&rsquo;s another helpful way to re-frame things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s to <strong>learn to focus on process not product</strong>.</p>
<p>Process means, the flow of time and the habits and actions associated with that flow of time. As in, I&rsquo;m going to spend 20 minutes working. Product is an outcome, for example, a homework assignment that you need to finish.</p>
<p>To prevent procrastination you want to avoid concentrating on product. Instead, <strong>your attention should be on building processes</strong>. Processes relate to simple habits, habits that coincidentally allow you to do the unpleasant tasks that need to be done.</p>
<p><strong>Your challenge is to avoid focusing on the product, the answers to the questions. The product is what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastinate. Instead, you need to focus on the process or processes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The small chunks of time you need over days or even weeks to answer the questions or prepare for tests. Who cares whether you finish the homework or grasp the key concepts in any one session. The whole point instead, is that you calmly put forth your best effort for a short period. The process.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For you, one of the easiest ways to focus on process is to focus on doing a Pomodoro, a 25 minute timed work session, not on completing a task.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By focusing on process rather than product, you allow yourself to back away from judging yourself, am I getting closer to finishing?</strong> And instead you allow yourself to relax into the flow of the work. The key is when a distraction arises, which it inevitably will, you want to train yourself to just let it flow by.</p>
